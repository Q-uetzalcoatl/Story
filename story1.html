            <img src="one.jpg" alt="Picture 1" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">Mum and Dad and Aunty Flo were hiding so many bright coloured</p> 
            <p class="story-text">Easter Eggs in Aunty Flo's big garden for the party.</p>
            <img src="two.jpg" alt="Picture 2" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">One Easter egg, <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span>, just wasn't pleased at all.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"I am far too easy to find, near these flowers and tall grass.</p>
            <p class="story-text">I thought an egg hunt was supposed to be hard!"</p>
            <img src="three.jpg" alt="Picture 3" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">"But not too hard..." a little <span class="pink-text">Shiny Pink Egg</span> nearby squeaked up.</p>
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> decided that hard was better than easy.</p>
            <p class="story-text">He looked around and started to roll...</p>
            <img src="four.jpg" alt="Picture 4" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">Where are you going?" Shing Pink Egg called after him.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"They aren't going to find me so fast," called <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span>.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"You wait and see!"</p>
            <img src="five.jpg" alt="Picture 5" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> rolled and rolled.</p>
            <p class="story-text">It was hard work rolling... He took a little rest and looked around.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"No, still too easy."</p>
            <p class="story-text">He looked around and saw a blue fence at the end of the garden.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"It's a long way for a little egg to roll, but a good place to hide!"</p>
            <img src="six.jpg" alt="Picture 6" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> started to roll off again.</p>
            <p class="story-text">He stopped for a rest. A butterfly asked him, "Where are you rolling?</p>
            <p class="story-text">All the other eggs are miles away...</p>
            <p class="story-text">"I want to be hard to find."</p>
            <img src="seven.jpg" alt="Picture 7" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> carried on rolling.</p>
            <p class="story-text">The Butterfly shook her wings. "It's a big garden!"</p>
            <p class="story-text">And that's how <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> got forgotten.</p>
            <img src="eight.jpg" alt="Picture 8" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">He heard a child laughing, shouting, "I've found one!"</p>
            <p class="story-text">"Here here...!" <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> tried harder.</p>
            <p class="story-text">But now he was in the high grass full of flowers, pink, and, yes, blue...</p>
            <p class="story-text">He shouted as loud as he could, but then he couldn't hear the children.</p>
            <img src="nine.jpg" alt="Picture 9" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">"They have gone indoors to look at their chocolate eggs,"</p>
            <p class="story-text">the butterfly laughed.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"You hid too hard..." And then the butterfly was gone.</p>
            <img src="ten.jpg" alt="Picture 10" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">And now what?</p>
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> looked around. It was a nice day, so he had a little sleep.</p>
            <img src="eleven.jpg" alt="Picture 11" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">But the weather changed quickly, it started to rain....</p>
            <p class="story-text"><span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> rolled under the bushes to stay a bit drier...</p>
            <img src="twelve.jpg" alt="Picture 12" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">The days passed by. <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> got droopier and sometimes wetter.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"Easter is over," two more passing butterflies told him.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"Nobody will find you now; they aren't even looking!"</p>
            <img src="thirteen.jpg" alt="Picture 13" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">"I hid too hard..." <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> decided, but then he heard a shout.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"Hey look! This Easter egg must have been forgotten!"</p>
            <p class="story-text">Two children carefully picked him out of the long grass.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"He looks a bit lost, and dirty...."</p>
            <p class="story-text">The little girl gave him a gentle rub with her hanky.</p>
            <p class="story-text">They took <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> back home.</p>
            <img src="fourteen.jpg" alt="Picture 14" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">"Better not to eat it..." Mum told them.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"He's been out in the sun and rain for days.</p>
            <p class="story-text">That's probably not good for chocolate.</p>
            <p class="story-text">And that's how <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> got cleaned up and put on a toy shelf in the children's bedroom next to the Easter Bunny....</p>
            <img src="fifteen.jpg" alt="Picture 15" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <p class="story-text">"Did I ever tell you about my adventures?" <span class="blue-text">Shiny Blue Egg</span> squeaked at Easter Bunny.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"Yes, too often..." Easter Bunny flapped his floppy ears.</p>
            <p class="story-text">"I wish they hadn't found you!"</p>
            <img src="end.jpg" alt="Picture 16" class="story-image img-fluid">
            <h1 class="end-text">THE END</h1>
